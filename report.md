# Technical Comparison Report

This report compares Ethereum (public), Hyperledger Fabric (private), and R3 Corda (consortium) blockchains.

**Ethereum** is highly decentralized with public access and global trustless execution, using Proof of Stake. It supports smart contracts in Solidity and has a native token (ETH). It’s ideal for open decentralized apps (dApps) and NFT or DeFi ecosystems.

**Hyperledger Fabric** is a modular private blockchain offering high throughput, privacy through private channels, and flexible smart contract development. It is well-suited for enterprise applications where parties are known and privacy is essential, such as supply chain tracking.

**R3 Corda** operates in a consortium setting with strong privacy features and a notary consensus model. It doesn't use global broadcasting and is built for secure inter-organizational transactions like banking and digital assets.

### Recommendations:
- **Decentralized App:** Ethereum – open access, token economy, large developer support.
- **Supply Chain Network:** Hyperledger Fabric – private, scalable, and supports complex workflows.
- **Inter-Bank Financial App:** R3 Corda – built specifically for financial agreements and privacy.
